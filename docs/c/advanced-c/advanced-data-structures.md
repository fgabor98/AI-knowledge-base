# Advanced Data Structures

Outline page for the C Programming roadmap.

## Scope

- Advanced C
- Embedded-oriented C programming
- Standard, implementation, platform, and toolchain boundaries

## Learning Objectives

- Define the problem addressed by this topic.
- Identify the relevant language rules and implementation assumptions.
- Apply the topic safely in host, freestanding, RTOS, or embedded Linux code.
- Recognize common failure modes and debugging evidence.
- Connect the topic to standards, tests, and production practices.

## Topic Outline

- Intrusive lists
- Ring buffers
- Lock-free queues
- Bitmaps
- Object pools
- Slab allocators
- Region allocators
- Hash tables
- Priority queues
- State machines
- Zero-copy buffers

## Exercises And Examples

- Add a minimal hosted example.
- Add an embedded-oriented example where applicable.
- Add a failure-focused example.
- Add tests, diagnostics, or measurement guidance.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating implementation behavior as portable ISO C behavior.
- Omitting lifetime, ownership, bounds, or concurrency assumptions.
- Ignoring the target platform and toolchain contract.
- Writing examples without failure handling or verification.

## References

- Add primary standards, compiler documentation, ABI references, manuals, and platform documentation during the content pass.
